1. Minimizing data collection:
![data-collection](data_collection.py)

    In this example, we are only collecting the user's name and email address, which are necessary for the application to function. We are not collecting any additional personal data that is not needed.

2. Implementing encryption:
![implement-encription](implement_encryption.py)

    we are using the hashlib library to hash the user's email address before storing it in the database. This helps to protect the email address from unauthorized access. Note that this is a one-way hash, meaning that it cannot be reversed to reveal the original email address.

3. Implementing access control:
![access-control](acess_control.py)

    we are using the Flask-Login library to require authentication before allowing the user to view their own data. This helps to ensure that only authorized users have access to the personal data.

4. Data protection regulations
![Data-Protection-Regulation](data_protection.py)

    we are using the Flask-WTF library to implement a signup form that collects user data. We are also using validators to ensure that the data is formatted correctly. This helps to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

5. Conducting regular security assessments
![regular-security](regular-security.py)
